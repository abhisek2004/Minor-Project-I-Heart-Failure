Requirements file for this project you've described, you need to list all the Python libraries and dependencies used in your code. Based on the provided code, hereâ€™s a `requirements.txt` file with the necessary libraries:

```
pandas==1.5.3
scikit-learn==1.2.0
matplotlib==3.7.1
seaborn==0.12.2
numpy==1.24.2
ydata-profiling==4.0.0
```

### Explanation:
1. **pandas**: Used for data manipulation (reading CSVs, DataFrame operations).
2. **scikit-learn**: Used for machine learning models (`LogisticRegression`, `KNeighborsClassifier`, `RandomForestClassifier`, etc.), preprocessing (`StandardScaler`, `train_test_split`, etc.), and metrics.
3. **matplotlib**: Used for plotting (e.g., `plt.show()` to display boxplots).
4. **seaborn**: Used for statistical plots, though it's not fully utilized in your code.
5. **numpy**: Used for numerical operations (e.g., arrays, mathematical operations).
6. **ydata-profiling**: For generating EDA reports (you used `ProfileReport`).

### Instructions to Install the Requirements:
1. Save this text as a `requirements.txt` file.
2. Run the following command in your terminal to install all the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

This will install the specified versions of the libraries, ensuring compatibility across different environments.
