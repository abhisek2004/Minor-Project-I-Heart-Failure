# Predictive Modeling for Heart Failure

## Project Summary

This project develops a predictive model for heart failure using machine learning techniques to identify high-risk patients and facilitate early intervention. By analyzing anonymized patient data, including demographics, medical histories, and clinical assessments, the model aims to empower healthcare professionals to make informed decisions.

### Key Features

- **Data Utilization:** The model leverages a rich dataset comprising various patient attributes, enabling accurate risk assessment.
- **Algorithm Performance:** Multiple algorithms were evaluated, with the Random Forest method achieving the highest performance with an AUC-ROC score of **0.89** and an accuracy of **0.93**. A Neural Network model followed closely with an accuracy of **0.86**.
- **Real-Time Assessments:** Implemented through a user-friendly Streamlit application, the model allows healthcare professionals to input patient data and receive real-time risk assessments, facilitating personalized treatment strategies.

### Benefits

- **Early Identification:** The predictive model aids in early identification of individuals at risk for heart failure, which is crucial for timely intervention.
- **Personalized Care:** The model supports individualized treatment plans, potentially reducing the frequency of severe heart failure episodes.
- **Clinical Applicability:** Future enhancements will focus on expanding the dataset and integrating real-time data from multiple hospitals to further improve the model's accuracy and practical application in clinical settings.

### Future Work

To enhance the model's performance and its utility in clinical environments, we plan to:

- Expand the dataset by including a diverse range of anonymized patient records from different healthcare institutions.
- Integrate real-time patient data to allow dynamic risk assessments and improve the model's predictive capabilities.
- Continuously refine algorithms and evaluate additional machine learning techniques to optimize accuracy and reliability.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Hardware:** Laptop with at least 8GB of RAM and 500GB of storage.
- **Operating System:** Windows.
- **Software:**
  - Python (preferably with Anaconda)
  - Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit

### Installation

**Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project:**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-failure-predictive-model.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd heart-failure-predictive-model
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Streamlit application:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. **Open your browser** and go to `http://localhost:8501` to view the application.

### Usage
